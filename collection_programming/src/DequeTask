mini -project: Task schedule system(using Dque)

A company wants to develop a task scheduler System to manage and execute different tasks based on their priority level.
Each task represent a job that must be performed in order of importance.

There are two types of tasks:

1.Normal Tasks - handled in the usual sequence 
	(added to the end of the queue).
2.High-priority Tasks - handled immediately
	(added to the front of the queue).

The must Write a java program that performs the following operations:

1.add Normal Task
	Input : Task name and description.
	add the task at the end of the Deque.
	
2.Add High - priority Tasks	
	Input : Task name and description.
	add the task at teh front of the Deque.

3.Execute Next Tasks	
	Remove and display the task from the front
	(describes executing that task).
	if no tasks are available , display a suitable message
	
4.Show all Pending Tasks
	Display all task currently in the Deque
	(from front to end)
	
	Task Format:
		[Task#ID] TaskName - Description(pripority)
		Example : [Task#1] backup Database - Nightly backup process(High)
		
5.Exit
	Stop the program execution.

Project Structure & Class Design
1.Task Class
	Fields:
			int taskId
			String taskName
			String taskDescription
			String priority
			
Constructor: Initializes all the above fields.

-taskId should auto-increment for each new task


Methods:

toString()-> return a string representation of the task in a clear format.

Example Output: 
	-[Task#1] Database backup 
	
	
2.TaskSchedule Class

Field : Deque<Task> taskQueue

Methods:
	-addNormalTask(String name,String description)
	adds a normal task to the end of the Deque Using addLast().
	
	-addHighPriorityTask(String name,String description)
	Adds a high-pripority task to the front of the Deque.
	using addFirst().
	
	-executeNaxtTask()
	Remove and display the task from the front of the Deque using removeFirst().
	If no tasks are available,display;
	"No tasks available to execute."
	
	-showAllTasks()
	display all tasks currently in the Deque (from front to end ).
	If no tasks are pending,display:
	"No pending tasks!"
	
Note: 
The Deque must be encapsulation inside the TaskSchedule class

use addFirst(), addLast(), and removeFirst() for task management.

3.TaskScheduleApp (main class)

Contains a menu-driven programn that lets the choose operation(1-5).

Use a Scanner object to task user input .

call the respective method from the TaskSchedule class.
